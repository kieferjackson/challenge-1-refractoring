# Challenge 1 - Refractoring
The purpose of this project was to refractor preexisting code in order to:
  (1) Consolidate CSS selectors when possible
  (2) Add comments in the CSS file to help organizing the selectors and describing their function

The first goal was accomplished by omitting unnecessary/superfluous classes and ids. Classes were used for elements that use CSS styling elements more than once or
for elements which may be used again in the future (i.e. the 'seo' class).
